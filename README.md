# Social Network API

This is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. The API is built using Express.js for routing, MongoDB as the database, and Mongoose as the ODM (Object Data Modeling) library.

## User Story

As a social media startup, I want an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database so that my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.


## Acceptance Criteria

- The server should start and the Mongoose models should be synced to the MongoDB database.
- The API should provide GET routes to retrieve data for users and thoughts in a formatted JSON.
- The API should support POST, PUT, and DELETE routes to create, update, and delete users and thoughts in the database.
- The API should support POST and DELETE routes to create and delete reactions to thoughts, and add and remove friends from a user's friend list.
